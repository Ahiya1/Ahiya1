# Ahiya — Method + Mission

I build **presence-first systems**.

- **Method → Keen (2L):** systems that build systems (recursive orchestration, agents, clean ops).
- **Mission → SelahOS:** systems that help humans reflect, regulate, and live in rhythm.

Everything else—Mirror of Truth/Dreams, Wealth—are applications that prove the pattern.

## Repository Map

### Method — systems that build systems
- **[keen](https://github.com/Ahiya1/keen)** — the recursive engine (a.k.a. 2L/Keen).
  _Mantra:_ "Let systems build systems."
- **[keens](https://github.com/Ahiya1/keens)** — experiments and staging for Keen.
- **[2l-claude-config](https://github.com/Ahiya1/2l-claude-config)** — prompt + pipeline config used to drive Keen/2L.
- **History:** `2con-init → a2 → a2s → a2s2` (archived lineage that led to Keen)

### Mission — systems that build selves
- **[SelahOS](https://github.com/Ahiya1/SelahOS)** — presence OS: daily/weekly rituals, reflection, analytics (current vision repo).
- **[selah-even](https://github.com/Ahiya1/selah-even)** → **[selah-even-v2](https://github.com/Ahiya1/selah-even-v2)** — "two rooms" prototypes that became SelahOS.

### Applications — proofs of the pattern
- **[mirror-of-truth](https://github.com/Ahiya1/mirror-of-truth)** (→ Mirror of Dreams) — reflective journaling & pattern synthesis.
- **[wealth](https://github.com/Ahiya1/wealth)** — conscious finance tracker generated by 2L. _(launching soon)_

## Philosophy
Presence is the real platform.
Method (Keen) makes building calm and repeatable.
Mission (SelahOS) makes living calm and repeatable.

> Build once, breathe always.
