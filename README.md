# Ahiya — Method + Mission

I build **presence-first systems**.

- **Method → Keens (2L):** systems that build systems (recursive orchestration, agents, clean ops).
- **Mission → SelahOS:** systems that help humans reflect, regulate, and live in rhythm.

Everything else—Mirror of Dreams, Wealth—are applications that prove the pattern.

## Philosophy
Presence is the real platform.
Method (Keens) makes building calm and repeatable.
Mission (SelahOS) makes living calm and repeatable.

> Build once, breathe always.
